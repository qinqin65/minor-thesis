	doi = {10.1109/ICSME.2017.20},
	abstract = {In the open source community such as GitHub, developers usually need to find projects similar to their work, with the aim to reuse their functions and explore ideas of features that could be possibly added into their project at hand. Traditional text search engine can help detect similar resources. However, it is difficult for developers to use in open source community because a few query words cannot describe the whole features of a project. In this paper, we present a practical software recommendation system, REPERSP, which is used to recommend personalized software projects in GitHub. According to the features of projects created by developers and their behavior to other known projects, REPERSP recommends the top N relevant and personalized software projects. Moreover, REPERSP is implemented with the MapReduce parallel processing frame - Apache Spark for large-scale data, which can be scaled to a large number of users and projects for practical usage. Empirical results show that REPERSP can recommend more accurate results compared with other two recommendation algorithms, i.e., UserCF (user collaborative filtering) and ItemCF (item collaborative filtering).

	abstract = {Supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning estimate a function given input/output samples. Generalization of the learned function to unseen data can be improved by incorporating side information into learning. Side information are data that are neither from the input space nor from the output space of the function, but include useful information for learning it. In this paper we show that learning with side information subsumes a variety of related approaches, e.g. multi-task learning, multi-view learning and learning using privileged information. Our main contributions are (i) a new perspective that connects these previously isolated approaches, (ii) insights about how these methods incorporate different types of prior knowledge, and hence implement different patterns, (iii) facilitating the application of these methods in novel tasks, as well as (iv) a systematic experimental evaluation of these patterns in two supervised learning tasks.},

	abstract = {With the rapid prevalence of mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobile applications (apps), app recommendation becomes an emergent task that would benefit both app users and stockholders. How to effectively organize and make full use of rich side information of users and apps is a key challenge to address the sparsity issue for traditional approaches. To meet this challenge, we proposed a novel end-to-end Knowledge Graph Convolutional Embedding Propagation Model (KGEP) for app recommendation. Specifically, we first designed a knowledge graph construction method to model the user and app side information, then adopted KG embedding techniques to capture the factual triplet-focused semantics of the side information related to the first-order structure of the KG, and finally proposed a relation-weighted convolutional embedding propagation model to capture the recommendation-focused semantics related to high-order structure of the KG. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.},

Owing to the outperformance of GNN in learning on graph data, GNN methods have been widely applied in many fields. In recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the efficient user/item embeddings from their interactions and side information if available. Since most of the information essentially has graph structure and GNNs have superiority in representation learning, the field of utilizing graph neural network in recommender systems is flourishing.

Software developers have various alternatives to contribute themselves to the communities and collaborate with others. However, nowadays there is no effective recommender suggesting developers appropriate repositories in both the academia and the industry. Although existing one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) approaches can be applied to this problem, they do not consider particular constraints of social coding such as the programming languages, which, to some extent, associate the repositories with the developers. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of leveraging user programming language preference to improve the performance of OCCF-based repository recommendation. Based on matrix factorization, we propose language-regularized matrix factorization (LRMF), which is regularized by the relationships between user programming language preferences. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world dataset of GitHub. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms five competitive baselines.},

	abstract = {GitHub contains millions of repositories among which many are similar with one another (i.e., having similar source codes or implementing similar functionalities). Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.},

Motivated by this trend, we describe a novel item-item cross-platform recommender system, paper2repo, that recommends relevant repositories on GitHub that match a given paper in an academic search system such as Microsoft Academic. The key challenge is to identify the similarity between an input paper and its related repositories across the two platforms, without the benefit of human labeling. Towards that end, paper2repo integrates text encoding and constrained graph convolutional networks (GCN) to automatically learn and map the embeddings of papers and repositories into the same space, where proximity offers the basis for recommendation. To make our method more practical in real life systems, labels used for model training are computed automatically from features of user actions on GitHub. In machine learning, such automatic labeling is often called distant supervision. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first distant-supervised cross-platform (paper to repository) matching system. We evaluate the performance of paper2repo on real-world data sets collected from GitHub and Microsoft Academic. Results demonstrate that it outperforms other state of the art recommendation methods.},

In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines.},

These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths.

	abstract = {Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, from content recommendation to identifying protein functions. However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

	abstract = {Session-based recommendation, which aims to predict the user’s immediate next action based on anonymous sessions, is a key task in many online services (e.g., e-commerce, media streaming). Recently, Self-Attention Network (SAN) has achieved signiﬁcant success in various sequence modeling tasks without using either recurrent or convolutional network. However, SAN lacks local dependencies that exist over adjacent items and limits its capacity for learning contextualized representations of items in sequences. In this paper, we propose a graph contextualized self-attention model (GC-SAN), which utilizes both graph neural network and self-attention mechanism, for sessionbased recommendation. In GC-SAN, we dynamically construct a graph structure for session sequences and capture rich local dependencies via graph neural network (GNN). Then each session learns long-range dependencies by applying the self-attention mechanism. Finally, each session is represented as a linear combination of the global preference and the current interest of that session. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that GC-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently.},

	abstract = {To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side information into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the attention mechanism.

Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

	abstract = {We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive , one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.},

The first one represents the meaning of a(n) entity (relation), the other one is used to construct mapping matrix dynamically. Compared with TransR/CTransR, TransD not only considers the diversity of relations, but also entities. TransD has less parameters and has no matrix-vector multiplication operations, which makes it can be applied on large scale graphs. In Experiments , we evaluate our model on two typical tasks including triplets classification and link prediction. Evaluation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Such an approach can not only alleviate the above mentioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide explanations for recommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collect recently published papers in this field, and group them into three categories, i.e., embedding-based methods, connection-based methods, and propagation-based methods. Also, we further subdivide each category according to the characteristics of these approaches. Moreover, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers utilize the knowledge graph for accurate and explainable recommendation.

A single spurious recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. Spurious recommendations do not result in serendipitous discoveries but rather cognitive dissonance. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to make inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate the folding metric definition on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. In studying the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems, we observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.},

Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models.
