\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I sincerely thank my supervisor Hai Dong for his patience and support. Without his support, this work would be difficult to continue. I also thank the GH Archive project for oppening their records of the public GitHub activities from developers and repositories to everyone. Without this open project, this work would also be hard to continue. Finally, I thank my families and friends for their help and supports.

\chapter{Introduction}
GitHub \footnote{https://github.com} is an open-source community that enables developers to manage their repositories via a version control system named Git \footnote{https://git-scm.com/}. Developers can also share their project and contribute to other developersâ€™ project in this community.

The recommender system for GitHub repositories is important. Developers tend to find repositories which are similar to the one they are working on to find functions or ideas which can be reused. Although the search engine provided by GitHub can help find similar repositories, it is always not accurate because it only uses the title of repositories rather than the whole details according to \cite{xu_repersp_2017}. While recommender systems can recommend the most relevant repositories to users based on the preference of users and repositories.

Most recommender systems have data sparsity and cold start issues. Due to the long tail effect, few popular products have the most ratings while lots of others have fewer ratings. As a result, the constructed user-item matrix is sparse. It is inefficient for a model to deal with a sparse matrix. If a user does not rate any items then it is hard for the recommender system to recommend items to that user. This is the cold start issue. Because in the beginning, there are always few ratings. Researchers have proposed various approaches to tackle these issues.

One of the approaches is to take the side information which was investigated by \cite{jonschkowski_patterns_2016} of users and items into consideration. Side information can be efficiently integrated into a knowledge graph neural network. With more information can be used to determine an user's preference, a recommender system thus can fight for data sparcity issues and improve the performance. The improvements are promising according to \cite{zhang_knowledge_2020} which applied side information and knowledge graph neural network in mobile APP recommendations.

Many existing works have proposed various GitHub recommender systems. But non of them can deal with the cold start problem because they ignored the use of the side information for the recommender system.

This work proposed a knowledge graph neural network based model to recommend Github repositories to developers. The performance and the ability to fight data sparcity issues are promising compared with traditional recommender systems.
